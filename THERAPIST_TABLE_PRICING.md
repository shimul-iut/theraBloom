# Therapist Table with Pricing & Duration

## Enhancement Overview
Added a "Pricing & Duration" column to the therapists table that displays all therapy types with their respective costs and session durations.

## Changes Made

### Backend (`backend/src/modules/users/users.service.ts`)

#### Updated `getUsers()` Method
1. **Expanded Pricing Query**: Now fetches `sessionDuration` and `sessionCost` along with therapy type names
2. **Added `pricingDetails` Field**: Creates a structured array with pricing information
3. **Maintains Specialization**: Still computes the comma-separated specialization field

```typescript
// Fetches full pricing data
therapistPricing: role === 'THERAPIST' ? {
  select: {
    sessionDuration: true,
    sessionCost: true,
    therapyType: {
      select: {
        name: true,
      },
    },
  },
} : false,

// Transforms into structured format
pricingDetails: [
  {
    therapyType: "Physical Therapy",
    duration: 60,
    cost: 60.00
  },
  // ...
]
```

### Frontend

#### Updated Interface (`frontend/hooks/use-therapists.ts`)
Added `TherapistPricingDetail` interface and `pricingDetails` field to `Therapist` interface:

```typescript
export interface TherapistPricingDetail {
  therapyType: string;
  duration: number;
  cost: number;
}

export interface Therapist {
  // ... existing fields
  pricingDetails?: TherapistPricingDetail[];
}
```

#### Updated Table (`frontend/app/therapists/page.tsx`)
Added new "Pricing & Duration" column that displays:
- Therapy type name
- Cost formatted as currency ($XX.XX)
- Duration in minutes
- Multiple entries stacked vertically for therapists with multiple therapy types

## Table Display Example

## Technical Details

### Backend Response Structure
```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "specialization": "Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy",
  "pricingDetails": [
    {
      "therapyType": "Physical Therapy",
      "duration": 60,
      "cost": 60.00
    },
    {
      "therapyType": "Occupational Therapy",
      "duration": 45,
      "cost": 50.00
    }
  ]
}
```

### Frontend Rendering
- Uses `map()` to iterate through pricing details
- Formats cost with `Number(p.cost).toFixed(2)`
- Displays each entry on a new line with `space-y-1`
- Uses semantic HTML with proper text sizing

## Performance

- **Single Query**: All data fetched in one database query
- **Efficient Join**: Uses Prisma's nested select
- **No N+1 Problem**: Pricing loaded with users, not separately
- **Minimal Overhead**: Only adds ~100 bytes per therapist

## Future Enhancements

Could add:
1. Tooltips with more details on hover
2. Color coding by price range
3. Sorting by average price
4. Filtering by price range
5. Icons for each therapy type
6. Expandable rows for more details

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/src/modules/users/users.service.ts`

### Frontend
