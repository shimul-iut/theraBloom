# Restart Backend Server

## The Issue
The backend server is running with an old version of the Prisma client that doesn't know about the new `specialization`, `sessionDuration`, and `sessionCost` fields.

## Solution: Restart the Backend Server

### Step 1: Stop the Backend Server
In the terminal where your backend is running, press:
```
Ctrl + C
```

### Step 2: Start the Backend Server Again
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

## Why This is Needed
When you run `npx prisma generate`, it updates the Prisma client files on disk, but the running Node.js process still has the old version loaded in memory. Restarting the server forces Node.js to reload the updated Prisma client.

## Verification
After restarting, try accessing the therapists endpoint. You should see:
- No more "Unknown field `specialization`" errors
- Therapists returned with specialization, sessionDuration, and sessionCost fields

## What Was Done
✅ Schema updated with new fields
✅ Migration created and applied to database
✅ Prisma client regenerated
✅ Seed data populated
❌ Backend server needs restart (DO THIS NOW)

## Quick Command
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C), then:
cd backend
npm run dev
```
