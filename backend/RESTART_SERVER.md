# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Restart Your Server!

## The Problem

The error `"expected": "string","received": "undefined","path": ["email"]` means your server is still running with the OLD code that expects an email field.

## The Solution

**You MUST restart your backend server** for the changes to take effect.

## 🐳 If Using Docker (RECOMMENDED PATH)

If you're running the backend in Docker, you need to **rebuild the container**:

```bash
# Quick rebuild (recommended)
docker-compose up -d --build backend

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f backend
```

See `../DOCKER_REBUILD.md` for detailed Docker instructions.

## 💻 If Running Locally (Without Docker)

### Step 1: Stop the Current Server

In your terminal where the server is running, press:
```
Ctrl + C
```

### Step 2: Regenerate Prisma Client (Just to be sure)

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma generate
```

### Step 3: Start the Server Again

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
🚀 Server running on port 3000
✅ Database connected
✅ Redis connected
```

### Step 4: Test Login Again

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phoneNumber": "01712345678", "password": "password123"}'
```

Or use the test script:
```bash
npx tsx backend/scripts/test-login-simple.ts
```

## Why This Happens

When you make code changes:
1. ✅ Files are updated on disk
2. ✅ Prisma schema is updated
3. ✅ Database is migrated
4. ❌ **But the running server still has old code in memory**

The server needs to be restarted to load the new code.

## If Using `npm run dev` with tsx watch

If you're using `tsx watch`, it should auto-restart, but sometimes it doesn't catch all changes. In that case:

1. Stop the server (Ctrl + C)
2. Run `npx prisma generate`
3. Start again with `npm run dev`

## Verify It's Working

After restart, you should see successful login:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "phoneNumber": "01712345678",
      "firstName": "Admin",
      "lastName": "User",
      "role": "WORKSPACE_ADMIN"
    },
    "tokens": {
      "accessToken": "...",
      "refreshToken": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

**TL;DR: Stop your server (Ctrl+C), run `npx prisma generate`, then `npm run dev`**
