### ✅ Task 9.3 - Zod Validation Schemas
All validation schemas created and integrated.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Payment Recording
- **General payments** - Record any payment from patient
- **Credit purchases** - Automatically adds to patient credit balance
- **Payment methods** - CASH, CREDIT_CARD, BANK_TRANSFER, PREPAID_CREDIT
- **Payment confirmation** - Tracks who confirmed the payment
- **Payment date** - Supports custom payment dates or defaults to now
- **Payment description** - Optional description field

### 2. Credit Balance Management
- **Automatic credit addition** - When payment method is PREPAID_CREDIT
- **Credit usage tracking** - Tracks sessions paid with credit
- **Credit refunds** - Handled automatically on session cancellation
- **Current balance** - Real-time credit balance
- **Purchase history** - All credit purchases with dates and amounts
- **Usage history** - All sessions paid with credit

### 3. Payment History
- **Complete transaction history** - All payments for a patient
- **Pagination support** - Efficient handling of large payment histories
- **Filtering** - By patient, payment method, date range
- **Confirmed by tracking** - Shows who recorded each payment

### 4. Credit Balance Details
- **Total purchased** - Sum of all credit purchases
- **Total used** - Sum of all sessions paid with credit
- **Current balance** - Available credit
- **Purchase list** - Detailed list of all credit purchases
- **Usage list** - Detailed list of all credit usage (sessions)

## Business Logic Highlights

### Credit Purchase Flow
```typescript
// 1. Record payment with PREPAID_CREDIT method
const payment = await prisma.payment.create({
  data: {
    patientId,
    amount: 500.00,
    method: 'PREPAID_CREDIT',
    confirmedBy: userId,
  },
});

// 2. Automatically add to patient's credit balance
await prisma.patient.update({
  where: { id: patientId },
  data: {
    creditBalance: {
      increment: 500.00,
    },
  },
});
```

### Credit Usage Tracking
```typescript
// Get all sessions paid with credit (excluding cancelled)
const creditUsage = await prisma.session.findMany({
  where: {
    patientId,
    paidWithCredit: true,
    status: { not: 'CANCELLED' }, // Cancelled sessions were refunded
  },
});

const totalUsed = creditUsage.reduce((sum, s) => sum + Number(s.cost), 0);
```

### Payment History
```typescript
// Get all payments for a patient with pagination
const payments = await prisma.payment.findMany({
  where: { patientId, tenantId },
  orderBy: { date: 'desc' },
  include: {
    confirmedByUser: true, // Who recorded the payment
  },
});
```

## Multi-Tenant Isolation

All operations properly implement multi-tenant isolation:
- All queries filtered by `tenantId`
- Cross-tenant access prevented
- Tenant validation in all operations

## Role-Based Access Control

Proper RBAC implemented:
- **Record Payment**: Admin/Operator only
- **Read operations**: All authenticated users

## Validation

Comprehensive validation using Zod:
- Required fields validation
- Amount must be positive
- Payment method enum validation
- Date format validation
- Patient ID validation

## Error Handling

Specific error codes for all scenarios:
- `PAYMENT_NOT_FOUND`
- `PATIENT_NOT_FOUND`
- `USER_NOT_FOUND`
- `FETCH_PAYMENTS_FAILED`
- `RECORD_PAYMENT_FAILED`
- `FETCH_CREDITS_FAILED`
- `FETCH_HISTORY_FAILED`

## Database Integration

Uses existing Prisma schema models:
- `Payment`
- `Patient` (creditBalance field)
- `Session` (paidWithCredit field)
- `User` (confirmedBy relation)

## Integration

Routes registered in `backend/src/server.ts`:
```typescript
app.use('/api/v1/payments', paymentsRoutes);
```

## Payment Methods

- **CASH** - Cash payment
- **CREDIT_CARD** - Credit card payment
- **BANK_TRANSFER** - Bank transfer
- **PREPAID_CREDIT** - Credit purchase (adds to patient's credit balance)

## Credit Balance Calculation

```
Current Balance = Total Purchased - Total Used

Where:
- Total Purchased = Sum of all PREPAID_CREDIT payments
- Total Used = Sum of all session costs where paidWithCredit = true (excluding cancelled)
```

## Testing

All TypeScript files compiled without errors:
- ✅ No type errors
- ✅ No linting errors (only unused parameter warnings in server.ts)
- ✅ Proper imports and exports

## Integration with Other Modules

### Session Module
- Sessions can be paid with credit (paidWithCredit flag)
- Credit is deducted when session is created
- Credit is refunded when session is cancelled

### Patient Module
- Patient has creditBalance field
- Patient has totalOutstandingDues field
- Both are updated automatically

## Next Steps

Task 9 is complete! Recommended next tasks:

**Task 10: Progress Reports Module**
- Create and manage progress reports
- Link reports to sessions
- Filter by patient and therapist

**Task 11: Reschedule Request Module**
- Handle reschedule requests from therapists
- 48-hour validation
- Approval/rejection workflow

## Notes

- Credit purchases automatically add to patient's credit balance
- Credit usage is tracked through sessions with paidWithCredit flag
- Cancelled sessions automatically refund credit
- Payment history includes who confirmed each payment
- All payments are tracked with timestamps
- Filtering supports patient, method, and date range
- Pagination available for all list endpoints
- Multi-tenant isolation enforced throughout
