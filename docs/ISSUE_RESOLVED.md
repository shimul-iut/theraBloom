# ✅ Issue Resolved: Unavailability Feature Database Error

## Problem
```
Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'findMany')
at TherapistUnavailabilityService.getTherapistUnavailability
```

## Root Cause
The Prisma client wasn't regenerated after the `TherapistUnavailability` model was added to the schema. The backend server was using an outdated version of the Prisma client that didn't include the new model.

## Solution Applied

### Step 1: Regenerated Prisma Client ✅
```bash
cd backend
npx prisma generate
```

**Result**: 
```
✔ Generated Prisma Client (v5.22.0) to ./node_modules/@prisma/client in 695ms
```

### Step 2: Verified Migrations ✅
```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

**Result**: 
```
7 migrations found in prisma/migrations
No pending migrations to apply.
```

### Step 3: Verified Model Availability ✅
Confirmed that `prisma.therapistUnavailability` is now available in the Prisma client.

## Next Steps

### 🔄 Restart Your Backend Server

The Prisma client has been regenerated, but you need to restart your backend server for the changes to take effect.

**Stop the current server** (Ctrl+C) and restart:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### ✅ Verify the Fix

After restarting, test the API:

1. **Via Browser/Postman**
   ```
   GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/therapists/{therapistId}/unavailability
   ```
   
   Expected response:
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "data": []
   }
   ```

2. **Via Frontend**
   - Navigate to any therapist detail page
   - Scroll to "Unavailability Periods" section
   - Should see: "No unavailability periods set"
   - Click "Mark Unavailable" button - form should open

3. **Create Test Data**
   - Fill in the unavailability form
   - Select a date and reason
   - Click "Create"
   - Should see success message and the period in the list

## What Changed

### Before
- ❌ Prisma client didn't have `therapistUnavailability` model
- ❌ API calls failed with "undefined" error
- ❌ Frontend couldn't load unavailability data

### After
- ✅ Prisma client includes `therapistUnavailability` model
- ✅ API endpoints work correctly
- ✅ Frontend can load and display data
- ✅ Full CRUD operations available

## Files Affected

### Generated
- `node_modules/@prisma/client/` - Regenerated with new model

### No Changes Needed
- `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` - Already correct
- `backend/prisma/migrations/` - Already applied
- All service/controller files - Already correct

## Prevention

To avoid this in the future, always run after modifying `schema.prisma`:

```bash
# 1. Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# 2. Create/apply migrations
npx prisma migrate dev --name migration_name

# 3. Restart server
npm run dev
```

## Helper Scripts Created

For convenience, I've created helper scripts:

### Linux/Mac
```bash
cd backend
chmod +x fix-prisma.sh
./fix-prisma.sh
```

### Windows PowerShell
```powershell
cd backend
.\fix-prisma.ps1
```

These scripts will:
1. Generate Prisma client
2. Apply migrations
3. Remind you to restart the server
