# Session Form Auto-Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Therapy Type Auto-Selection
**Behavior:**
- When a therapist is selected, the therapy type is automatically set to their specialization
- The therapy type dropdown becomes **disabled** and shows a muted background
- Helper text displays: "Auto-selected based on therapist's specialization"
- Users cannot manually change the therapy type once a therapist is selected

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Auto-select therapy type based on therapist's specialization
if (therapist.specializationId) {
  setValue('therapyTypeId', therapist.specializationId);
}
```

### 2. ✅ End Time Auto-Calculation
**Behavior:**
- End time input is now **disabled** and read-only
- Automatically calculated based on:
  - Start time (user input)
  - Session duration from therapist's profile
- Updates in real-time when start time changes
- Shows helper text: "Calculated based on session duration"

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Calculate end time: startTime + sessionDuration
const [hours, minutes] = startTime.split(':').map(Number);
const startMinutes = hours * 60 + minutes;
const endMinutes = startMinutes + therapist.sessionDuration;
const endTime = formatTime(endMinutes);
```

## User Experience Flow

### Before Changes
1. Select patient
2. Select therapist
3. **Manually select therapy type** ❌
4. Enter date
5. Enter cost
6. Enter start time
7. **Manually enter end time** ❌
8. Submit

### After Changes
1. Select patient
2. Select therapist → **Therapy type auto-selected** ✅
3. Enter date
4. Enter cost (auto-filled)
5. Enter start time → **End time auto-calculated** ✅
6. Submit

## Benefits

### 1. Reduced Errors
- ❌ Can't select wrong therapy type for a therapist
- ❌ Can't enter incorrect end time
- ✅ Ensures data consistency

### 2. Faster Data Entry
- 2 fewer fields to manually fill
- Automatic calculations reduce cognitive load
- Streamlined workflow

### 3. Better UX
- Clear visual feedback (disabled fields with muted background)
- Helper text explains what's happening
- Real-time updates as user types

### 4. Data Integrity
- Therapy type always matches therapist's specialization
- Session duration always accurate
- No manual calculation errors

## Visual Indicators

### Therapy Type Field
```
Therapy Type *
[Physical Therapy (60 min)] ← Disabled, muted background
Auto-selected based on therapist's specialization
```

### End Time Field
```
End Time (Auto-calculated)
[11:00] ← Disabled, muted background
Calculated based on session duration
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: John Smith (Physical Therapy, 60min)
1. User selects "John Smith" as therapist
2. **Therapy Type** → Auto-set to "Physical Therapy" (disabled)
3. User enters start time: "10:00"
4. **End Time** → Auto-calculated to "11:00" (disabled)
5. **Cost** → Auto-filled to "$60.00"

### Scenario 2: Sarah Williams (Speech Therapy, 30min)
1. User selects "Sarah Williams" as therapist
2. **Therapy Type** → Auto-set to "Speech Therapy" (disabled)
3. User enters start time: "14:00"
4. **End Time** → Auto-calculated to "14:30" (disabled)
5. **Cost** → Auto-filled to "$45.00"

### Scenario 3: Changing Start Time
1. Therapist selected: Michael Brown (45min sessions)
2. Start time: "09:00" → End time: "09:45"
3. User changes start time to "10:00"
4. **End time automatically updates to "10:45"** ✅

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- Uses therapist's `specializationId` for therapy type
- Uses therapist's `sessionDuration` for end time calculation
- Watches `startTime` for real-time recalculation

### Edge Cases Handled
1. **No therapist selected**: Therapy type shows "Select therapist first"
2. **No start time**: End time remains empty until start time is entered
3. **Therapist without specialization**: Field remains enabled
4. **Time overflow**: Handles cases where end time goes past midnight

### Form Validation
- Therapy type: Still required, but auto-filled
- End time: Still included in form submission, but auto-calculated
- Start time: User input, required field

## Code Changes

### Files Modified
- ✅ `frontend/components/schedule/session-form.tsx`

### Key Changes
1. Added `disabled` prop to therapy type Select when therapist is selected
2. Added `disabled` prop to end time Input (always disabled)
3. Updated useEffect to auto-select therapy type from `specializationId`
4. Added separate useEffect for real-time end time recalculation
5. Added helper text for both fields
6. Added muted background styling for disabled fields

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Select therapist → Therapy type auto-selects
- [ ] Try to change therapy type → Should be disabled
- [ ] Enter start time → End time auto-calculates
- [ ] Change start time → End time updates
- [ ] Select different therapist → Therapy type and calculations update
- [ ] Submit form → All data including auto-calculated fields are sent
- [ ] Verify session created with correct therapy type and end time

## Future Enhancements

Could add:
1. Visual indicator showing the duration (e.g., "60 min session")
2. Warning if session overlaps with existing sessions
3. Suggested start times based on therapist availability
4. Color coding for different therapy types

## Summary

The session form is now smarter and more user-friendly:
- **Therapy type** is automatically selected based on therapist's specialization (not editable)
- **End time** is automatically calculated based on start time + session duration (not editable)
- Both fields show clear visual indicators and helper text
- Reduces data entry errors and speeds up the workflow
