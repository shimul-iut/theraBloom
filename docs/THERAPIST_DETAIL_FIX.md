# Therapist Detail Page & Specialization Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Specialization Column Showing in Therapists List
**Problem:** The therapists list page was displaying a "Specialization" column, but the `specialization` field doesn't exist in the Prisma User schema.

**Solution:**
- Removed `specialization` property from `Therapist` interface in `frontend/hooks/use-therapists.ts`
- Removed the specialization column from the therapists list table in `frontend/app/therapists/page.tsx`

**Note:** Therapist specialization is now implied by their pricing configuration (which therapy types they offer).

### 2. ❌ Therapist Detail Page Returns 404
**Problem:** Clicking the eye icon (View Details) on a therapist returned a 404 error because the detail page didn't exist.

**Solution:**
- Created `frontend/app/therapists/[id]/page.tsx` - Complete therapist detail page
- Created `frontend/app/therapists/[id]/layout.tsx` - Layout wrapper for proper sidebar display

## New Therapist Detail Page Features
