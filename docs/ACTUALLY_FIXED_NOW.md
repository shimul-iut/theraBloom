# ✅ Issue Actually Fixed Now!

## What Was The Problem

Your backend runs in Docker with an isolated `node_modules` volume. When we regenerated Prisma client on your host machine, the Docker container didn't see it.

## What I Did To Fix It

### 1. Regenerated Prisma Client INSIDE Docker Container
```bash
docker-compose exec backend npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Restarted Backend Container
```bash
docker-compose restart backend
```

### 3. Fixed Relation Names in users.service.ts
Changed `specialization` → `TherapyType` (4 occurrences)

## Result

✅ `therapistUnavailability` model is now available  
✅ All relation names match the schema  
✅ Backend is running without errors  

## Test It

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/therapists/{therapistId}/unavailability
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": []
}
```

## For Future Reference

When you modify `schema.prisma` and your backend is in Docker:

1. **Generate Prisma client in Docker:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec backend npx prisma generate
   ```

2. **Restart the container:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart backend
   ```

Don't just run `npx prisma generate` on your host - it won't affect the Docker container!

**Status**: ✅ FIXED  
**The unavailability feature is now working!**
