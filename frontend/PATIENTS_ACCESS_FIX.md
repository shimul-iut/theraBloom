# Patients Page Access - Fixed ✅

## Issues Identified

### 1. ✅ Layout Issue - FIXED
The patients pages weren't wrapped in the dashboard layout, causing them to not have the sidebar/header.

**Solution:** Created `frontend/app/patients/layout.tsx` to wrap all patient pages with the dashboard layout.

### 2. ✅ Menu Visibility - Working as Designed
The "Patients" menu item is **role-based** and only visible to:
- **ADMIN** users
- **OPERATOR** users

**THERAPIST** users don't see the Patients menu because they have limited access.

### 3. Logout Issue - Possible Causes

If you're being logged out when accessing `/patients`, it could be:

**A. You're logged in as THERAPIST**
- Therapists don't have access to the Patients page
- The backend returns 403 Forbidden
- Solution: Login as Admin or Operator

**B. Token expired**
- Access token expires after 15 minutes
- Solution: The app should auto-refresh, but you may need to login again

**C. Backend not running**
- If backend is down, API calls fail
- Solution: Make sure backend is running on port 3000

## How to Test

### 1. Login as Admin (Full Access)
```
Phone: 01712345678

- You should see "Patients" in the sidebar
- Clicking it should load the patients page

### 2. Login as Operator (Full Access)
```
Phone: 01812345678
Password: password123
```

### 3. Login as Therapist (No Access)
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you're still being logged out:

1. **Check browser console** for errors
2. **Check Network tab** to see which API call is failing
3. **Verify backend is running** on port 3000
4. **Check your role** - make sure you're logged in as Admin or Operator
5. **Clear localStorage** and login again:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   localStorage.clear();
   // Then refresh and login again
   ```

### If Patients menu is not showing:

1. **Check your role** - Only Admin and Operator see it
2. **Refresh the page** after logging in
3. **Check the sidebar code** - it should filter by role
